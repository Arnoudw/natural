## Introduction
`natural` is a watchface for the Pebble smartwatch.  This face displays the day/night cycle for your location using your phone's location and sunrise/sunset times from http://www.openweathermap.org. The watch features a 24h analog clockface with noon at the top and midnight at the bottom.  The sun's position tells the time and also gives an approximate location of the Sun in the sky when viewed from the northern hemisphere looking south.  The lunar phase and approximate moon location are also displayed on the clockface.

## Installation
The app is not currently ready for public release.  If you have the Pebble SDK, you can build the app on your own from source.
